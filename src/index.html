                        <td>The Blowfish is a hash function, created by Bruce Schneier in 1993, and was one of the first hash algorithms to be freely distributed. That's why it is used quite a lot. The encryption key is very long and mostly random, which makes blowfish very difficult to break at the moment. The version of blowfish using 16 iterations is still inviolate.</td>

Though, MD5 is not collision resistant, and it isn't suitable for applications like SSL certificates or digital signatures that rely on this property.</td>

It is a a strengthened version of the RIPEMD algorithm which produces a 128 bit hash digest while the RIPEMD-160 algorithm produces a 160-bit output.</td>

                        <td>Keccak is based on a novel approach called sponge construction. Sponge construction is based on a wide random function or random permutation, and allows inputting ("absorbing" in sponge terminology) any amount of data, and outputting ("squeezing") any amount of data, while acting as a pseudorandom function with regard to all previous inputs. This leads to great flexibility.</td>

                        <td>RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an algorithm used by modern computers to encrypt and decrypt messages. It is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm. Asymmetric means that there are two different keys. This is also called public key cryptography, because one of the keys can be given to anyone. The other key must be kept private.</td>
